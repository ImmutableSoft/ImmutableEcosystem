**ERC20Upgradeable**

Implementation of the {IERC20} interface.
 This implementation is agnostic to the way tokens are created. This means
 that a supply mechanism has to be added in a derived contract using {_mint}.
 For a generic mechanism see {ERC20PresetMinterPauser}.
 TIP: For a detailed writeup see our guide
 https://forum.zeppelin.solutions/t/how-to-implement-erc20-supply-mechanisms/226[How
 to implement supply mechanisms].
 We have followed general OpenZeppelin Contracts guidelines: functions revert
 instead returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless
 conventional and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20
 applications.
 Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.
 This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just
 by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit
 these events, as it isn't required by the specification.
 Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance}
 functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting
 allowances. See {IERC20-approve}.

### __ERC20_init

Sets the values for {name} and {symbol}.
 The default value of {decimals} is 18. To select a different value for
 {decimals} you should overload it.
 All two of these values are immutable: they can only be set once during
 construction.

```js
function __ERC20_init(string name_, string symbol_) internal nonpayable onlyInitializing 
```

**Arguments**

| Name        | Type           | Description  |
| ------------- |------------- | -----|
| name_ | string |  | 
| symbol_ | string |  | 

### __ERC20_init_unchained

```js
function __ERC20_init_unchained(string name_, string symbol_) internal nonpayable onlyInitializing 
```

**Arguments**

| Name        | Type           | Description  |
| ------------- |------------- | -----|
| name_ | string |  | 
| symbol_ | string |  | 

### name

Returns the name of the token.

```js
function name() public view
returns(string)
```

**Arguments**

| Name        | Type           | Description  |
| ------------- |------------- | -----|

### symbol

Returns the symbol of the token, usually a shorter version of the
 name.

```js
function symbol() public view
returns(string)
```

**Arguments**

| Name        | Type           | Description  |
| ------------- |------------- | -----|

### decimals

Returns the number of decimals used to get its user representation.
 For example, if `decimals` equals `2`, a balance of `505` tokens should
 be displayed to a user as `5.05` (`505 / 10 ** 2`).
 Tokens usually opt for a value of 18, imitating the relationship between
 Ether and Wei. This is the value {ERC20} uses, unless this function is
 overridden;
 NOTE: This information is only used for _display_ purposes: it in
 no way affects any of the arithmetic of the contract, including
 {IERC20-balanceOf} and {IERC20-transfer}.

```js
function decimals() public view
returns(uint8)
```

**Arguments**

| Name        | Type           | Description  |
| ------------- |------------- | -----|

### totalSupply

See {IERC20-totalSupply}.

 - the caller must have a balance of at least `amount`.

```js
function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) public nonpayable
returns(bool)
```

**Arguments**

 is the maximum `uint256`.
 Requirements:
 - `from` and `to` cannot be the zero address.
 - `from` must have a balance of at least `amount`.

| from | address |  | 
| to | address |  |

### increaseAllowance

Atomically increases the allowance granted to `spender` by the caller.
 This is an alternative to {approve} that can be used as a mitigation for
 problems described in {IERC20-approve}.

```js
function increaseAllowance(address spender, uint256 addedValue) public nonpayable

| spender | address |  | 
| addedValue | uint256 |  | 

### decreaseAllowance

Atomically decreases the allowance granted to `spender` by the caller.

 e.g. implement automatic token fees, slashing mechanisms, etc.
 Emits a {Transfer} event.
 Requirements:

| ------------- |------------- | -----|
| from | address |  | 
| to | address |  |

 This internal function is equivalent to `approve`, and can be used to
 e.g. set automatic allowances for certain subsystems, etc.
 Emits an {Approval} event.
 Requirements:
 - `owner` cannot be the zero address.
 - `spender` cannot be the zero address.

```js
function _approve(address owner, address spender, uint256 amount) internal nonpayable
```

**Arguments**

### _spendAllowance

Updates `owner` s allowance for `spender` based on spent `amount`.
 Does not update the allowance amount in case of infinite allowance.

### _beforeTokenTransfer

Hook that is called before any transfer of tokens. This includes
 minting and burning.
 Calling conditions:
 - when `from` and `to` are both non-zero, `amount` of ``from``'s tokens
 will be transferred to `to`.
 - when `from` is zero, `amount` tokens will be minted for `to`.
 - when `to` is zero, `amount` of ``from``'s tokens will be burned.
 - `from` and `to` are never both zero.
