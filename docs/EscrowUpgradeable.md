**EscrowUpgradeable**

Base escrow contract, holds funds designated for a payee until they
 withdraw them.
 Intended usage: This contract (and derived escrow contracts) should be a
 standalone contract, that only interacts with the contract that instantiated
 it. That way, it is guaranteed that all Ether will be handled according to
 the `Escrow` rules, and there is no need to check for payable functions or
 transfers in the inheritance tree. The contract that uses the escrow as its
 payment method should be its owner, and provide public methods redirecting
 to the escrow's deposit and withdraw.
