**Initializable**

This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed
 behind a proxy. Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an
 external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer
 function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.
 TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as
 possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.
 CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure
 that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.
 [CAUTION]
 ====
 Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.
 An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation
 contract, which may impact the proxy. To initialize the implementation contract, you can either invoke the
 initializer manually, or you can include a constructor to automatically mark it as initialized when it is deployed:
